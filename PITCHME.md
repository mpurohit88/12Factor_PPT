# Why 12 Factor ?

#HSLIDE

## I. Codebase
- One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
- Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor
- The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy.

#HSLIDE

## II. Dependencies
- Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

#HSLIDE

## III. Config
- Store config in the environment

#HSLIDE

## IV. Backing services
- Treat backing services as attached resources

#HSLIDE

## V. Build, release, run
- Strictly separate build and run stages

#HSLIDE

## VI. Processes
- Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

#HSLIDE

## VII. Port binding
- Export services via port binding

#HSLIDE

## VIII. Concurrency
- Scale out via the process model

#HSLIDE

## IX. Disposability
- Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

#HSLIDE

## X. Dev/prod parity
- Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

#HSLIDE

## XI. Logs
- Treat logs as event streams

#HSLIDE

## XII. Admin processes
- Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
